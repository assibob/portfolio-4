You must work from the code as given. Refactoring is encouraged and expected, but the integrity of the given approach must be maintained.  
**In your submission, you must include a listing of which functionalities from the list below you have implemented.** 

Any feature marked with ** is considered compulsory. Some features are interdependent and might requier you to do them in a spesific order (this is part of the challange to figure out). We have made cirtain that the code includes examples of everything you will need to do. You complete as many features as you are able to while wrting good clean code. 

The game is started with the command : <code>node game.mjs</code>

## Features (Tasks)
** The starting level has an empty slot in the surrounding wall. This slot should function as a door into the level called "aSharpPlace." Implement the door functionality so that the player can proceed to the next level.  
** Create a new level (a third level) and link the unused door in "aSharpPlace" to exit into the new room.  
** In "aSharpPlace," implement teleport functionality for the "♨︎" symbols. Entering one should move the player to the other.(i cant get it to work for the life of me)
** Ensure that when going back through a door, the player returns to the correct room.  
** Make the X NPC characters perform a simple patrol (+/-2 from their starting locations).  
** Create an animated splash screen (this was a group assignment from a previous week) using `splashScreen.mjs`. (idk what you mean by this)
